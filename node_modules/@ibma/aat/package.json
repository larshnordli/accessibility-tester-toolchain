  "readme": "# Automated Accessibility Tester for NodeJS\n\n## Overview\n\n`@ibma/aat` is a NodeJS Module that allows you to perform integrated accessibility testing within a continuous integration pipeline such as Travis CI.\n\n`@ibma/aat` is a NodeJS module that scans a Selenium WebDriver or parsed document. It allows you to perform integrated accessibility testing within a continuous integration pipeline such as Travis CI while using a variety of test frameworks such as Cucumber, Mocha, or Jasmine. `@ibma/aat` allows users to scan HTML nodes/widgets, URLs, local files, HTML documents, and HTML content in the form of a string. Aside from just performing accessibility scanning, `@ibma/aat` provides a framework to validate accessibility scan results against baseline files and/or simply failing the testcases based on the levels of violations found during the scan.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n  - [Install](#install)\n    - [Authentication](#authentication)\n    - [Install Locally](#install-locally)\n    - [Install on Travis CI](#install-on-travis-ci)\n      - [Generate Personal Auth Token](#generate-personal-auth-token)\n      - [Enabling CI](#enabling-ci)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n  - [Configuring `AAT`](#configuring-aat)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [APIs](#apis)\n  - [AAT.getCompliance(`content`, `label`, `callback`)](#aatgetcompliancecontent-label-callback)\n  - [AAT.assertCompliance(`actualResults`)](#aatassertcomplianceactualresults)\n  - [AAT.getDiffResults(`label`)](#aatgetdiffresultslabel)\n  - [AAT.getBaseline(`label`)](#aatgetbaselinelabel)\n  - [AAT.diffResultsWithExpected(`actual`, `expected`, `clean`)](#aatdiffresultswithexpectedactual-expected-clean)\n  - [AAT.stringifyResults(`results`)](#aatstringifyresultsresults)\n- [Errors](#errors)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n- [Feedback](#feedback)\n  - [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Setup and Initialize - Follow the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [Install](#install) instructions.\n1. Configure AAT - Follow the [Configuration](#Configuration) instructions.\n1. Learn how to use APIs to perform accessibility scans - Refer to [Usage](#usage) and [APIs](#apis) documentation.\n1. Give us feedback.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Install NodeJS and NPM: [via installer](http://w3.hursley.ibm.com/java/jim/ibmsdksfornodejs/ibmsdksfornodejsversion4/index.html)\n1. Some testing framework (e.g., mocha, jasmine)\n1. Browser automation / parser (e.g., Selenium, Zombie)\n\n### Install\n\n#### Authentication\n\nIBM's npm Enterprise instance is configured to use IBM's GitHub Enterprise SSO (OAuth) authentication, which is a 2 step authentication process.\n\nLogin using registry\n```console\n$ npm login --registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com --scope=@ibma\n```\n\nWhen prompted for `username`, `password`, and `email`, simply provide your w3Id credentials.\nAfter doing so, the npm client will be granted an unresolved token that is stored in your `~/.npmrc` file.\n\ni.e.\n\n```concole\ndevans@<hostname>:~$ npm login --registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com --scope=@ibma\nUsername: devans\nPassword: <w3id passowrd>\nEmail: (this IS public) devans@ca.ibm.com\nLogged in as devans to scope @ibma on https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/.\n```\n\nFor more information, visit the npm Enterprise docs: https://npme.npmjs.com/docs/cli/configuration.html#single-sign-on-authentication-saml-oauth-20\n\n#### Install Locally\n\nPerform the steps outlined at [Authentication](#authentication) before trying to install this module.\n\nInstall `@ibma/aat` plugin from IBM npm server locally:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install @ibma/aat --registry https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com --save-dev\n```\n\nNote: The first time you try to install after [Authentication](#authentication) it could fail with the following error message:\n\n> npm ERR! visit https://github.ibm.com/login/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=...... to validate your session : @ibma/aat\n\nOpen this link in your browser, then try again\n\n#### Install on Travis CI\n\n##### Generate Personal Auth Token\n\nTo integrate npm Enterprise with Travis CI you need to generate a `.npmrc` file that references IBM's npm Enterprise instance with an authentication token. Follow the instructions outlined at [Authentication](#authentication) and then refer to the steps below.\n\nLook in your `~/.npmrc` file, you will see an entry that looks something like this:\n\n`//npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/:_authToken=[NPM_TOKEN]`\n\nCopy `[NPM_TOKEN]` somewhere safe.\n\n##### Enabling CI\n\nNow that you have a token:\n\n* Enable CI for your repo on Travis CI (Whitewater TravisCI is https://travis.ibm.com)\n* [Define Variable in Repository Settings](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) called `NPM_TOKEN` and set this equal to `[NPM_TOKEN]` from [Generate Personal Auth Token](#generate-personal-auth-token)\n* Create/update your `.travis.yml` file in your project that looks like this:\n\n    ```yaml\n    language: node_js\n    node_js:\n    - \"node\"\n    before_install:\n    - printf \"@ibma:registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/\\n//npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}\" >> .npmrc\n    ```\n\n* Now in your `package.json` you can simply add the following:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"devDependencies\": {\n        \"@ibma/aat\": \"^1.1.0\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\nFor further information, see the official npm Enterprise docs: https://npme.npmjs.com/docs/workflow/travis.html\n\nNote: The first time you try to install it will fail with the following error message:\n\n> npm ERR! visit https://github.ibm.com/login/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=...... to validate your session : @ibma/aat\n\nOpen this link in your browser, then try again.\nThis will be case inside Travis CI environment as well, but once you have visited the URL it will authenticate your `NPM_TOKEN` so you can continue to use it in TRAVIS CI.\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Configuring `AAT` \n\nConfiguring `AAT` plugin involves constructing a `.aat.yml` file in the project root, which will contain all the configuration\noptions for `AAT`. Following is the structure of the `.aat.yml` file:\n\n```yml\n# optional - Specify the rule pack server to use. (Where to pull the rules and engine from)\n# Default: https://cc-rules.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/js/latest/\nrulePack: https://cc-rules.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/js/latest/\n\n# optional - Specify one or many policies to scan.\n# i.e. For one policy use policies: CI162_5_2_DCP080115\n# i.e. Multiple policies: CI162_5_2_DCP080115,CI162_5_2_DCP070116 or refer to below as a list\n# Default: null (all policies)\n# Refer to README.md FAQ section on details to get the policy ID.\npolicies:\n    - CI162_5_2_DCP070116\n\n# optional - Specify one or many violation levels on which to fail the test\n#            i.e. If specified violation then the testcase will only fail if\n#                 a violation is found during the scan.\n# i.e. failLevels: violation\n# i.e. failLevels: violation,potential violation or refer to below as a list\n# Default: violation, potentialviolation\nfailLevels:\n    - violation\n    - potentialviolation\n\n# optional - Specify one or many violation levels which should be reported\n#            i.e. If specified violation then in the report it would only contain\n#                 results which are level of violation.\n# i.e. reportLevels: violation\n# i.e. reportLevels: violation,potentialviolation or refer to below as a list\n# Default: violation, potentialviolation, recommendation, potentialrecommendation, manual\nreportLevels:\n    - violation\n    - potentialviolation\n    - recommendation\n    - potentialrecommendation\n    - manual\n\n# Optional - Which type should the results be outputted to\n#   outputFormat: json\n# Default: json\noutputFormat:\n    - json\n\n# Optional - Specify labels that you would like associated to your scan\n#\n# i.e.\n#   label: Firefox,master,V12,Linux\n#   label:\n#       - Firefox\n#       - master\n#       - V12\n#       - Linux\n# Default: N/A\nlabel:\n    - master\n\n# optional - Where the scan results should be saved.\n# Default: results\noutputFolder: results\n\n# optional - Where the baseline results should be loaded from\n# Default: baselines\nbaselineFolder: test/baselines\n\n# optional - Should Hidden content be scanned\n# true --> Yes scan hidden content\n# false --> Don't scan hidden content\n# Default: false\ncheckHiddenContent: false\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nFollowing is how to perform an accessibility scan within your testcases and verifying the scan results:\n\n```javascript\n// Perform the accessibility scan using the AAT.getCompliance API\nAAT.getCompliance(testDataFileContent, testFile, function (results) {\n\n    // Call the AAT.assertCompliance API which is used to compare the results with baseline object if we can find one that\n    // matches the same label which was provided.\n    var returnCode = AAT.assertCompliance(results);\n\n    // In the case that the violationData is not defined then trigger an error right away.\n    expect(returnCode).toBe(0, \"Scanning \" + testFile + \" failed.\");\n\n    // Mark the testcases as done, when using jasmine as the test framework.\n    done();\n});\n```\n\nRefer to [Examples](https://github.ibm.com/IBMa/Tools-Boilerplates/tree/master/Node-AAT) for sample usage scenarios.\n\n## APIs\n\n### AAT.getCompliance(`content`, `label`, `callback`)\n\nExecute accessibility scan on provided content. Content can be in the following form:\n* HTML content (String)\n* Single node/widget (HTMLElement)\n* Local file path (String)\n* URL (String)\n* Document node (HTMLDocument)\n* Selenium WebDriver (WebDriver)\n\nNote: When using Selenium WebDriver the AAT.getCompliance API will only take Selenium WebDriver (WebDriver) instance.\n\nUsing a callback mechanism (`callback`) to extract the results and perform assertion using AAT APIs.\n\n* `content` - (String | HTMLElement | HTMLDocument | Selenium WebDriver) content to be scanned for accessibility violations.\n* `label` - (String) unique label to identify this accessibility scan from others. Using \"/\" in the label allows for directory hierarchy when results are saved.\n* `callback` - (Function) callback that is invoked (indicating success). The callback will be invoked with the ```results```\nas a parameter to the callback function provided. Following is the outline of the results object which will be passed to the callback function:\n\n```javascript\nvar results = {\n    scanID: \"12c6717d-69c4-4fe7-ab30-4e16067a0f5a\",\n    toolID: \"@ibma/aat-v1.1.0\",\n    label: \"src/HelloWorld.html\",\n    URL: \"https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/\",\n    summary: {\n        counts: {\n            violation: 1,\n            potentialviolation: 0,\n            recommendation: 0,\n            potentialrecommendation: 0,\n            manual: 0\n        },\n        scanTime: 29,\n        policies: [\n            \"CI162_5_2_DCP070116\"\n        ],\n        reportLevels: [\n            \"violation\",\n            \"potentialviolation\",\n            \"recommendation\",\n            \"potentialrecommendation\",\n            \"manual\"\n        ],\n        startScan: 1470103006149\n    },\n    reports: [\n        {\n            frameIdx: 0,\n            frameTitle: \"Frame 0\",\n            issues: [\n                {\n                    severityCode: \"eISHigh\",\n                    messageCode: \"wcag20.tech.aria.OrphanedContent\",\n                    ruleId: \"1088\",\n                    help: \"idhi_accessibility_check_g1088.html\",\n                    msgArgs: [],\n                    bounds: {\n                        left: 10,\n                        top: 11,\n                        height: 24,\n                        width: 163\n                    },\n                    level: \"violation\",\n                    xpath: \"/html[1]/body[1]/a[1]\",\n                    snippet: \"\\<a href='#navskip'\\>\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nRefer to `actualResults` parameter in [AAT.assertCompliance](#aatassertcomplianceactualresults) API for more details about the properties of results object.\n\n### AAT.assertCompliance(`actualResults`)\n\nPerform assertion on the scan results. Will perform one of the following assertions based on the condition that is met:\n\n1. In the case of a baseline file is provided and available in memory for these scan results, a compare of baseline to `actualResults` will be made. In this case if `actualResults` matches baseline, it returns 0, otherwise returns 1. For this case, assertion is only run on the xpath and ruleId.\n\n2. In the case of NO baseline file is provided for this particular scan, assertion will be made based on the provided `failLevels`. In this case, it returns 2 if there are failures based on failLevels. (violation level matches at least one provided in the `failLevels` object)\n\n* `actualResults` - (Object) results for which assertion needs to be run.
